`bf: BrainF*ck`

Brainfuck (often abbreviated as BF) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by
Urban MÃ¼ller. It is designed to challenge and amuse programmers rather than being practical for
everyday programming tasks. Brainfuck has a minimalistic and concise syntax, consisting of only eight commands.

The language operates on an array of memory cells, initially set to zero. It uses a single pointer
that can move left or right along the array. Each memory cell holds a single byte of data.

The eight Brainfuck commands are as follows:

1. `>`: Increment the pointer, moving it to the right.
2. `<`: Decrement the pointer, moving it to the left.
3. `+`: Increment the value in the current memory cell by one.
4. `-`: Decrement the value in the current memory cell by one.
5. `.`: Output the value in the current memory cell as a character.
6. `,`: Read a character from input and store it in the current memory cell.
7. `[`: If the value in the current memory cell is zero, jump forward to the corresponding ] command.
	Otherwise, continue to the next command.
8. `]`: If the value in the current memory cell is nonzero, jump back to the corresponding [ command.
	Otherwise, continue to the next command.

Brainfuck programs consist of a sequence of these commands, with any other characters treated as comments
and ignored. The programs manipulate the memory cells and perform operations based on the provided commands.
Programs can be quite challenging to write and understand due to their minimalistic nature.

Here's an example of a simple Brainfuck program that prints "Hello, World!":

```
	++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.
```

Brainfuck has gained popularity as a programming language for code golfing (writing programs with the smallest possible size)
and for creating complex algorithms with very concise code. However, it is not intended for practical use due to its limited
expressiveness and difficulty of comprehension.

While Brainfuck can be an interesting intellectual challenge, it is not recommended for everyday
programming tasks or serious software development.
